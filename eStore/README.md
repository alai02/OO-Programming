## Description
The general problem of this assignment is to create a EStore that serves as a store that
hold products which are either books or electronics. 
This project has a GUI java interface so the user can interact with a nice interface rather than using the command line interface. 
The assumptions made for this assignment was that the
input file is going to be in a certain format. When you create an instance of the EStore you will have access to a arraylist of Products and a hashmap that takes the name as the key

## Compilation
 Open project into Netbeans and click run on the EStoreSearch.java file

Other: cd into alai02_a3 directory and use the javac compiler to compile: javac *.java to comepile all 
java files in working directory

## Usage
Enter: java EStoreSearch [file_path] (e.x: products.txt)

## Known limitations
This program can only add products of type book and of type electronic. 
The search functionality of this program only searches the list for the name key and no other members. 

## References
labs were refereneced for my file io, try and catch blocks, override and the first and second assignment spec was read. No other resources were nessisary as the class notes had countless examples. 

## Future improvements
1. Add more functionality to the EStore like remove an item 
2. Add functionality to modify data of products 
3. Change the GUI element to create a better design that has a more material design look. 
4. Implement a more full fealtured search function

## Testing
EStoreSearch class provided to create an EStoreSearch instance or by using the existing one I have created. 
Test plan document is located in a seperate file.
